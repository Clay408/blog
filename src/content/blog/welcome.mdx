# Welcome to My Tech Blog!

Hello and welcome! This is my personal tech blog where I share my thoughts, tutorials, and insights about software development and technology.

## About This Blog

This blog is built with modern web technologies including:

- **Next.js 15** - A React framework for production
- **React Three Fiber** - For 3D graphics and animations
- **MDX** - Markdown + JSX for rich content
- **Tailwind CSS** - Utility-first CSS framework

## What to Expect

I'll be writing about:

1. Web development best practices
2. Frontend and backend technologies
3. Tools and frameworks I use
4. Personal projects and experiments

## Stay Tuned

More articles coming soon! Feel free to explore the 3D particle background that's powered by React Three Fiber.

```typescript
// Here's a sample code block
function greet(name: string) {
  return `Hello, ${name}!`;
}

console.log(greet('World'));
```
