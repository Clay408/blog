# Exploring Next.js 15 Features

Next.js 15 brings exciting new features and improvements to the framework. Let's explore what's new!

## React 19 Support

Next.js 15 includes support for React 19, bringing with it all the latest improvements and features from the React team.

## Enhanced App Router

The App Router continues to improve with better:

- **Server Actions** - More streamlined server-side mutations
- **Partial Prerendering** - Improved performance with selective rendering
- **Improved Data Fetching** - Better patterns for fetching data

## Improved Performance

Next.js 15 includes several performance improvements:

```typescript
// app/page.tsx
async function getData() {
  const res = await fetch('https://api.example.com/data', {
    next: { revalidate: 3600 } // Cache for 1 hour
  });
  return res.json();
}

export default async function Page() {
  const data = await getData();

  return (
    <main>
      <h1>Latest Data</h1>
      <pre>{JSON.stringify(data, null, 2)}</pre>
    </main>
  );
}
```

## Better TypeScript Support

TypeScript integration has been improved with better type inference and fewer configuration needs.

## Turbopack (Stable)

Turbopack is now stable for Next.js development, providing faster build times:

```bash
next dev --turbopack
```

## Conclusion

Next.js 15 is a significant update that brings improved performance, better developer experience, and support for the latest React features.
